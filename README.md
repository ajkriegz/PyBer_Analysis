# PyBer_Analysis
This analysis was performed using Python 3.7.13, conda 4.13.0, and Jupyter notebook.

## Overview
This analysis organizes ride-sharing data by city type and visualizes total weekly fares per city type.

## Results
Below are a summary of the dataset as a whole and a summary chart of the total fare by city type.

* Suburban cities had five times more rides than rural cities while urban cities had thirteen times more rides than rural cities.

* Suburban cities had more than six times as many drivers as rural cities while urban cities had more than thirty times the number of drivers in rural cities.

* Total fares for suburban cities were almost four and a half times higher than total fare for rural cities. Total fares for urban cities were nine times higher than total fares for rural cities.

* The average fare per ride in suburban cities is about eleven percent smaller than the average fare per ride in rural cities, while the average fare per ride in urban cities is about twenty-nine percent smaller.

* The average fare per driver in suburban cities is about twenty-nine percent smaller than in rural cities, while the average fare per driver in urban cities is about seventy percent smaller.

* When comparing differences in total fare per city type on the PyBer Fare Summary graph, urban cities had near zero dollar weeks but were consistently in the zero to five hundred dollar range. Meanwhile, suburban areas had a small peak in January with a spike in late February. Urban areas had more volatility but had more peaks throughout the spring.

## Summary

Based on the differences in data by city type, here are three business recommendations to address disparities between the city types. Refer to the Summary DataFrame image above.

1. While rural and suburban cities had fewer drivers than rides, urban cities show an abundance of drivers. The sparse number of drivers correlates with a higher average fare per ride and per driver. In order to keep costs down for the consumer, we recommend that PyBer incentivize new drivers in rural and suburban cities with a one-time bonus upon completion of a set number of rides. This will increase the supply of drivers and lower the rates for users in rural cities.

2. Additionally, to incentivize PyBer drivers to make themselves available in suburban and rural cities, we recommend offering an increased percentage of the fare to drivers in cities and areas where there are increased wait times or inflated rates, scaled to the population or need. This initiative will help to spread PyBer's abundance of drivers out of urban cities into suburban and rural cities. The effect is two-fold: the rural and suburban cities will receive more drivers to keep costs down for the consumer; and urban cities will have fewer drivers, raising the average fare from its current deflated rate.

3. Finally, we recommend introducing a scheduling system into the PyBer app. With the option to schedule a ride at a specific time, our systems will have more information and time to optimize routes in areas with fewer drivers. With recommendation number two, this would further help drivers heading from larger cities to smaller cities.
